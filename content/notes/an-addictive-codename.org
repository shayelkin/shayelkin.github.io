#+title: An Addictive Codename
#+date: 2018-10-02

Years ago, at one of my first software jobs, my team and I were tasked with
rewriting a math app to utilize a new software framework. That framework had the
codename /Glass/, and we followed that theme and gave the app itself the
codename /Crystal/, or /Crystal Math/ in full.

As it was far from finished, the app couldn't run by itself, so we wrote a tool to
run the lines of code that were ready, and named that tool /Lines/.

The team was quite productive, with everyone crackin' hard and running /Lines/
of /Crystal Math/ all day long. Or at least we did until management found out,
and insisted we'd replace those codenames with less addictive ones.
