If you were on a video call with me, you must've seen the prints hanging
behind me. Colleagues often ask about them:

Hanging to my left is a signed print by [[https://www.davidreeb.com/][David Reeb]] of his 2021 painting titled
/Two Emperors (Hadrianus & Vespasian)/.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title David Reev, Two Emperors (Hadrianus & Vespasian) (2021)
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Black and white print depicting two classical Roman emperor busts side by side, defaced with crude black markings of oversized sunglasses and exaggerated toothy grins drawn over their faces

Mr. Reeb had the following to say about it (published in [[https://tohumagazine.com/he/article/%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%98%D7%A4%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%94-%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%93%D7%95%D7%93-%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%91][Tohu Magazine, 2021]];

Take here those portraits […] the “tyrant” emperors who are another model of
politicians. To me, they and Putin represent something similar, they represent
authority, a splendor that is inherently ridiculous.

On the wall to my right hangs a reproduction of a [[https://fdr.artifacts.archives.gov/en/objects/20669/learn-to-operate-a-7000000-sub][U.S. Navy recruitment poster
from 1944]], captioned /Learn To Operate a $7,000,000 Sub/.

#+ATTR_HTML: :title Learn To Operate A $7,000,000 Sub (1944)
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt 1944 U.S. Navy recruitment poster showing a shirtless sailor standing before a submarine control panel filled with gauges and valves. The sailor gives the viewer a come hither look. Text in red, blue, and black reads 'LEARN TO OPERATE A $7,000,000 SUB' above and 'Join the submarine service' below

If someone asks about it, I joke it is an ad for Kubernetes (iykyk).
