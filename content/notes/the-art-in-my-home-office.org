If you were on a video call with me, you must've seen the prints hanging
behind me. Colleagues often ask about them:

Hanging to my left is a signed print by [[https://www.davidreeb.com/][David Reeb]] of his 2021 painting titled
/Two Emperors (Hadrianus & Vespasian)/.

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt A black and white painting of two Roman busts, side by side. On top of the classical looking busts, there's a cruder markings in black of sunglasses, and huge, toothy grins.

Reeb had the following to say about it (in [[https://tohumagazine.com/he/article/%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%98%D7%A4%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%94-%D7%A2%D7%9D-%D7%93%D7%95%D7%93-%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%91][Tohu Magazine, 2021]]; translation mine):

Take here those portraits […] the “tyrat” emperors who are another model of
politicians. To me, they and Putin represent something similar, they represent
authority, a splendor that is inherently ridiculous.

On the wall to my right hangs a reproduction of a [[https://fdr.artifacts.archives.gov/en/objects/20669/learn-to-operate-a-7000000-sub][U.S. Navy recruitment poster
from 1944]], captioned /Learn To Operate a $7,000,000 Sub/.

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt A drawing of a shitless sailor, standing in front of a wall full of gagues and valves. He is giving the viewer a come hither look. An all caps text in red, blue and black above and below him reads "Learn to operate a $7,000,000 SUB: Join the submarine service"

If someone asks about it, I joke it is an ad for Kubernetes (iykyk).
